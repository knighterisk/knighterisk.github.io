			<h2>Hi friends,</h2>

				Below is a GIF of my character <em>Spermesto</em> that I first conceived of last Spring.
				He is a friendly sperm cell with kind eyes.
				I think that he's a very endearing character.

				<h3>Spermesto's theme (acapella)</h3>

				<h3>Spermesto's theme (acoustic guitar)</h3>
				<p>Here is my acoustic guitar cover of Spermesto's theme. It translated surprisingly well to guitar, hooray!<p/>
