			<h1>Hey chat</h1>
			<p/>Jige is the mastermind of the incident. She’s really upset about the way humans are treating the earth, not just in Gensokyo, but around the world. Humans famously exploit the earth for its resources, degrading the soil and threatening wildlife. She’s a god of “overburden,” which refers to the rocks, soil, and life that we have to move out of the way to reach more extrinsically valuable resources, like coal or copper. Speaking more broadly, she’s the god of the things which we take for granted, and all the things hidden beneath us (both literally and figuratively) which keep our world afloat. While she’s tried to keep a stone face through all of the exploitation and degradation, she’s finally snapped, and plans to take away the planet’s soil out of spite.</p>
			<p/>Trying to convince her to give humanity another chance, Javier apologized on behalf of humanity and offered to have a beautiful palace built for Jige, constructed solely out mud. Unfortunately, all it was able to do was delay her wrath. Fearing that Reimu’s intervention may further anger Jige, he tries to get her to turn back.</p>
